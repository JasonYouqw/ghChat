## ghChat(react version)

I hope that this project can be a chat tool for GitHub. So I will try to make it do some integration with GitHub. At present，it just support logging in with GitHub authorization and look GitHub user public information in ghChat. You can create group in ghChat for your github project and post the group link in the readme to convenient for the users' communication.

If you have anything idea about integration, welcome to create issues about feature suggestion, bug feedback or send pull requests.

### Development

1. clone project code
```
git clone https://github.com/aermin/react-chat.git
```


2.  create an empty file that names 'secret.js' in the root directory of this project.

But if you want to log in with GitHub authorization, use third part cdn to send files in chat, or separate configuration for DB, jwt secret, you should add content as follows in secret.js. So without this authorization, you just can't use features about send files and log in with GitHub.

```
module.exports = {
  client_secret: '', // client_secret of github authorization:  github-> settings ->  Developer settings to get 
  db: {
    host: '', 
    port: ,
    database: '',
    user: '',
    password: '',
  },
  secretValue: '', // secret of json web token
  qiniu: { // qiniu cdn configuration
    accessKey: '',
    secretKey: '',
    bucket: ''
  }
};
```

3. download npm module for front end

```
cd react-chat
```

```
npm i
```

4. download npm module for the back end
```
cd cd react-chat/server 
```

```
npm i
```

5. init DB
```
// You should create a MySQL DB which name ghchat in local
DB configuration follows 'react-chat/server/config.js'

npm run init_sql
```

6. run front end and back end code
```
npm run start
```

```
cd ..  
```

```
npm run start
```
